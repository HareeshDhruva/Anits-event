          Attending a Holi festival feels like so much more than just throwing
          colors and taking a few pictures. It gets you out of the monotony of
          late winter and interacting with friends or family you might not
          normally have fun with. The Holi celebrations I attended were always
          extremely inclusive — my Hindu relatives, young and old, were excited
          to share the day with anyone interested in celebrating.

            One of the most remarkable things about the Indian color festival is
            how enthusiastic and care-free it is. It is purely a day of fun. I
            didn't love being dragged to temple as a child, but going to temple
            for Holi was an exception. Because running around throwing colors
            was something I could always get on board with.
